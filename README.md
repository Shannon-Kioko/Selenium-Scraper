# Web Scraper for Automating Role Updates

## Overview

This project is a web scraper designed to automate the process of updating user roles on a webpage.
The scraper uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate through pages of student data and automatically updates roles that are labeled as "No Role" to "Student." This automation helps to reduce the manual workload involved in managing user roles and ensures data consistency.

## Features

- **Automated Navigation:** Automatically navigates through multiple pages of student data.
- **Role Identification:** Identifies rows with the "No Role" status.
- **Role Update:** Updates "No Role" entries to "Student" based on specific conditions.
- **Error Handling:** Includes error handling for common issues such as element visibility and connectivity.
